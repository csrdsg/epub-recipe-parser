# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-25  
**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

---

## Quick Stats

- **Tests**: 280/280 passing (100%)
- **Coverage**: 87%
- **Code Quality**: All checks passing (black, ruff, mypy)
- **Real-world Validation**: 99.4% ingredient extraction success
- **Bugs Fixed**: 31 (20 in Round 1, 11 in Round 2)

---

## Production Readiness

### ✅ Ready for Production

- Core extraction engine (99.4% success rate)
- Quality scoring system
- Database storage with tagging
- CLI interface (6 commands)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full type safety
- Security hardened (SQL injection protected)

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Time Extraction**: Works perfectly with structured metadata ("Prep Time: 20 minutes") but cannot extract from narrative text ("bake for 20 minutes")
2. **Cookbook Format**: Best results with modern, structured cookbooks (digital-first, recipe blogs)
3. **Non-cookbook Detection**: May process technical books if they contain recipe-like patterns

## Recent Achievements

### Ingredient Extraction (Nov 25, 2025)
- **Before**: 43.6% success rate
- **After**: 99.4% success rate
- **Impact**: +92 recipes recovered from test set

### Quality Scoring (Nov 25, 2025)
- **Before**: Misleading (incomplete recipes scoring 60/100)
- **After**: Honest assessment (incomplete recipes score <30)
- **Impact**: Accurate filtering and quality metrics

### Code Quality (Nov 25, 2025)
- **Bugs Fixed**: 31 total (security, type safety, correctness)
- **Test Coverage**: Increased from 64% to 87%
- **Type Safety**: All mypy errors resolved

- [x] Instruction extraction (100% success)
- [x] Metadata parsing (serves, times, methods)
- [x] Quality scoring system
- [x] Database storage with SQLite
- [x] Tagging system
- [x] Schema versioning

### In Progress 🔄

- [ ] Example recipes/cookbooks
- [ ] Additional export formats

### Planned 📋

- [ ] Web interface (optional)
- [ ] Full-text search (FTS5) for large datasets (10,000+ recipes)
- [ ] Schema normalization for very large datasets
- [ ] NLP-based time extraction (for narrative-style cookbooks)
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Cookbook format detection
- [ ] Recipe deduplication

---

## Performance

### Extraction Speed
- Single cookbook (50-100 recipes): 10-15 seconds
- Batch processing: ~7-8 recipes/second
- Database queries: < 10ms average

### Scalability
- **Current Scale**: Optimized for 10-1,000 cookbooks
- **Database Size**: 3.4MB for 603 recipes (very efficient)
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate (no leaks detected)
